      <p>A trip to the grocery store used to be something feasible for many. Picking up a carton of eggs because you ran through them slightly faster than the week before was no problem, buying an extra pack of chicken because you know you can store one in the freezer for emergencies was a given, and the list goes on.</p>
      
      <p>However, in recent years shoppers in the U.S. have seen an uptick in grocery prices unlike any before it — a concern for people of all ages and economic statuses, but particularly those living on a fixed income.</p>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">According to data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USA), the price of most groceries has increased in the past year by 1.3%. These items range from dry goods (flour, sugar, etc.) to meat (poultry, red meat, pork, etc.). From August to September 2024, the increase was 0.4%.</p>
      
      <p>The price of eggs alone has increased 10 percent in the last year, according to the USDA.</p>
      
      <p>Shoppers have expressed frustration and wondering if this increase in prices has an end in sight, or even an explanation as to why this is happening.</p>
      
      <h2><strong>Causes of Rising Prices</strong></h2>
      <p>There are a variety of attributes that are causing the dramatic increase in price at local retail grocery stores, starting with agriculture.</p>



      <p>While it is challenging to detect the individual impact of one event on the price of groceries in an entire county, Montgomery County, Maryland, has been negatively impacted by the effects of saltwater intrusion. This occurs when the sea levels rise, and salt water makes contact with soil. This causes an increase in salinity in the soil, spoiling several farms and harvests.</p>

      </div>

      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Montgomery County relies heavily on the Eastern Shore for grain, which plays a significant role in producing dry goods. The uptick in salinity in the soil is causing supply chain issues in receiving those materials.</p>

      </div>
  
      <p style="margin-top: 10px;">Additionally, supply chain issues tracing back to the COVID-19 pandemic have impacts on today's methods of trade. For example, NIH officials wrote that “altered food purchasing patterns may have been compounded by the closure of one of the three county grocery stores in early 2020 and the farmers’ market in summer 2021, resulting in a consistent decline in food-sourcing venues during the acute phase of the pandemic.”</p>
      
      <p>The researchers mention they believe a portion of the increase in groceries today can be attributed to the loss of food-sourcing venues that never reopened. According to the Federal Trade Commission, “retailers that depended on periodic sales promotions to drive sales and traffic saw a decrease in the number of producer-funded promotions and an increase in their relative costs. In contrast, retailers that focused on everyday low pricing (“EDLP”) instead of periodic promotions (“high-low pricing”) were less affected by the decrease in producer-funded promotions.”</p>
